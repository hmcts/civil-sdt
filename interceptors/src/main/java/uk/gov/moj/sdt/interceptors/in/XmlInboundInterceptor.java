/**
 * Interceptor class which handles bulk submission message received by SDT.
 * 
 * This interceptor is necessary in order to process the raw XML sent to SDT before CXF has turned it into JAXB objects,
 * after which any non generic portions of the XML (those portions which are case management system specific) will no
 * longer be visible. This is because the XSD defined for SDT treats the case management specific portions of the XML as
 * part of an <any> tag. This non generic XML must be stored in the database as a blob and the details of its content
 * should be hidden from SDT. SDT stores the entire XML in ThreadLocal storage so that it can be retrieved later and
 * various portions of it used to populate the domain objects with the raw XML before storing them in the database via
 * Hibernate.

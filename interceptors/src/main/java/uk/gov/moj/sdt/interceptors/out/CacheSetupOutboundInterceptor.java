/**
 * This interceptor stores the original output stream created by CXF (with application server implementation specifics
 * within it) and replaces it with a caching output stream. This has 2 purposes: it allows data being written to the
 * stream to be retrieved so that it can be enriched with additional raw XML as required by SDT for its handling of
 * non-generic content; and it avoids writing any data to the remote endpoint until we are ready to write the enriched
 * content. This interceptor must be run after the original endpoint has been created and before the first write to the
 * output stream has been performed by StaxOutInterceptor. The cache output stream is setup in anticipation of the
 * processing done by XmlOutboudInterceptor and ServiceRequestInterceptor.
